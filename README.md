# YouTube playlists playback tracker

Have you ever gone back to a long playlist on YouTube and realized that you'd
forgot which video was your last?  Then this userscript is for you!  This
userscript remembers which video you've watched last in a playlist, so that you
don't have to.

The source code is distributed under the terms of the MIT Licence.  See
[LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for details.

## How to install

1. To install this userscript in your browser you'll need a browser extension
   for managing userscripts:

   - I recommend [https://www.tampermonkey.net/](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
   - More options are listed on <https://greasyfork.org/> (section "Step 1:
     install a userscript manager")

2. Once you have a browser extension for userscripts installed, just click on
   button "Install this script" on [Greasy Fork][greasyfork].  The browser
   extension will automagically detect the userscript.

## How it works

After you watch a video in a playlist (URL must contain parameters `list` and
`v`, [example][BackToTheFuture2]) for at least a minute, the userscript will
remember this video for this playlist.  Then, when you later open [the
playlist][VFXcool] again, the script will show you were you've stopped.
